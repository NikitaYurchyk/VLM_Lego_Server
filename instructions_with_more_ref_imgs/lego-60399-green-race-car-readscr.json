        "LEGO Audio & Braille Building Instructions for the LEGO City Great Vehicles set \"Green Race Car\". \n\nGear up for high-speed fun with the LEGO City Green Race Car. Get behind the wheel of this supercool racer  and  prepare for pedal-to-the-metal action! Make a tire-screeching start, zip around bends  and  whiz past the photographer to cross the finish line in record time! Then take a lap of honor with the winner's trophy before heading to the next racetrack. \n\nThe box cover shows the green race car with black  and  orange airbrushing and the number 40 on the engine hood. The car is speeding around the racetrack, it's so fast that the tires are positively smoking! The driver has a self-confident smile on her face as she is maneuvering the vehicle. On the side of the racetrack, a sports photographer is taking a picture of the racer. In the background of the scene, the spectator stands surrounding the racetrack are packed with excited fans. Some of the garages of the different race cars are also visible, but they are all empty of course as the cars are racing each other at the moment. Now,  it's time for you to join the race – ready, set, go! \n\nOpen the box. This can be tricky; ask someone to help you! \n\nThe box contains 1 booklet with visual building instructions, 2 unnumbered bags, and 1 loose piece: a wagon bottom 6x10 with 4 connectors. \n\nCarefully open all bags. Before you start building, ask a sighted person to help you sort the pieces by color. This makes finding the correct pieces even easier!",
        "Collect the following 2 pieces: \n\n1 white, black and bright orange upper part of the body, \n\nand 1 white pair of legs.",
        "Put the upper body on the legs. Make sure that hands  and  toes are pointing in the same direction. The elbows should bend to the back.",
        "You have finished building the entire set! Fantastic job! Now it's time to put your skills to the test on the racetrack: make sure your car is in top shape, put on your racing helmet, get into the driver's seat  and  wait for the start signal! Who will win the sought-after trophy? Oh, and  don't forget the winner's smile when you pass the photographer!",
        "Enjoy!"
